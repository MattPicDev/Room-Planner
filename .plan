# Room Planner - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A visual room layout application that allows users to design room layouts on a grid-based canvas.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useReducer)
- **Styling**: CSS modules

## Phase 1: Core Features (Current)

### 1. Grid System
- [x] Project scaffolding
- [ ] Render grid canvas (graph paper style)
- [ ] Configurable grid size (default: 10px squares)
- [ ] Pan and zoom functionality
- [ ] Grid snapping for objects

### 2. Line Drawing
- [ ] Draw lines along grid lines (horizontal/vertical only)
- [ ] Line drawing modes: wall, door, window
- [ ] Edit existing lines (move endpoints, delete)
- [ ] Line properties: thickness, color, type
- [ ] Validation: prevent overlapping lines

**Note**: Future version will support diagonal/free-form lines

### 3. Furniture Management
- [ ] Define furniture templates (rectangular shapes)
  - Name
  - Dimensions (width x height in grid squares)
  - Color/style
- [ ] Furniture library/palette
- [ ] Place furniture on grid
- [ ] Move furniture (drag and drop)
- [ ] Rotate furniture (90° increments)
- [ ] Delete furniture from layout
- [ ] Furniture collision detection

### 4. Data Persistence
- [ ] Local storage for furniture templates
- [ ] Local storage for current layout
- [ ] Export layout as JSON
- [ ] Import layout from JSON

**Note**: Future version will support per-user cloud storage

## Phase 2: Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Diagonal and curved line drawing
- Non-rectangular furniture shapes
- User authentication and cloud storage
- Multiple room layouts per user
- Measurement tools (distance, area)
- Export to image/PDF
- Furniture search and filtering
- Undo/redo functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Touch screen support

## Development Workflow

### Git Commits
Each feature implementation must include:
1. **Code**: Implementation of the feature
2. **Tests**: Unit and integration tests
3. **Documentation**: Updated README and inline comments

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for React components
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Manual testing checklist for UI interactions

### Documentation Requirements
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- README with setup instructions
- API documentation for key functions
- User guide for application features

## Requirements Summary

### Version 1.0 Requirements
1. ✅ Grid-based canvas (graph paper style)
2. ⏳ Line drawing along grid lines
3. ⏳ Line editing (move, delete)
4. ⏳ Rectangular furniture definition
5. ⏳ Furniture placement and manipulation
6. ⏳ Local data persistence

### Constraints
- Lines must follow grid lines (no diagonals yet)
- Furniture must be rectangular
- No user authentication (local storage only)
- Desktop-first design

### Success Criteria
- User can create a basic room layout with walls
- User can define and place furniture
- Layout persists across browser sessions
- All features have test coverage >80%
- Documentation is complete and accurate
